				<p>This research project was part of a large study exploring digitally augmented popups. I worked as part of a transdisciplinary research team including an urban planner, architect, electrical engineer, interaction
				designer and computer scientist. As the study took place at the University of Sydney campus, we focused the engagement context around transport
				infrastructure to and from campus. This ensured that the engagement
				topic was relevant to the local community. It was further loosely linked
				to an initiative at our university concerned with active transport on
				campus. We consequently developed our engagement strategy to encourage people to stop and vote, provide feedback, and express their
				opinions about transport infrastructure on and around the campus through a collection of interactive modules, including a touchscreen transit information screen, a selfie voting app (vote with the transport option you took to university), a chalkboard, and a chalk drawing robot (tallying the votes from live tweets to our popup's Twitter hashtag).

		<h3>Molypoly</h3>

			<div class="text">
				<p>Currently, first-year chemistry students at the University of Tasmania learn about three-dimensional molecular structures using a combination of lectures, tutorials, and practical hands-on experience with molecular chemistry kits. We have developed a basic 3D molecule construction simulation, called MolyPoly, to help students grasp the concepts of chemistry easily through immersion and natural interaction with 3D molecules. It was designed to augment the teaching of organic chemistry with enhanced natural interaction and 3D visualization techniques. This paper presents the results of a pilot study conducted with the aforementioned chemistry class. Participating students were split into two groups; MolyPoly and traditional. The results demonstrated that the two groups have achieved similar learning outcomes at the end of the four (4) class sessions.
